# Scrum Simulator 🚀

## Project Objective 🎯

Welcome to the Scrum Simulator project! This simulation tool lets you step into the exciting world of Scrum, with a cast
of characters including an Admin 👑, Students 👨‍🎓, Game Master 🧙‍♂️, Moderator 🧐, and Observer 👀.

Our mission 🌟 is to create an immersive experience in which students can become developers 🛠️, Scrum Masters 🦸‍♂️, or
Product Owners 📦, and take part in a lifelike narrative of a Scrum board. The game setup is carefully crafted by a Game
Master, the mastermind 🧙‍♂️, and closely monitored by a Moderator to ensure an authentic Scrum adventure.
